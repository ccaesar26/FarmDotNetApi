The pods are left to dry on the plant until they turn from green to ochre or brown. Once 90% of the pods are dry, they can be harvested. Flax can also be grown as sprouts, which have a slightly spicy flavor. The seeds and oil are high in omega-3 fatty acids and are used as nutritional supplements.

Flax does best in cooler climates, and can be direct seeded outdoors in the early spring as soon as the soil can be worked. Flax grows best in self-supporting patches, like grains, and should be broadcasted and raked. Seeds can be tossed with flour before sowing to help them spread evenly across the soil. Flax's slender stems grow quickly and produce pale blue flowers 15-25mm in diameter that mature into round seed pods containing 4-10 glossy brown seeds. The pods are left to dry on the plant until they turn from green to ochre or brown. Once 90% of the pods are dry, they can be harvested. Flax can also be grown as sprouts, which have a slightly spicy flavor. The seeds and oil are high in omega-3 fatty acids and are used as nutritional supplements. Flax fibers are two to three times as strong as cotton fibers and are naturally smooth and straight. Linseed meal, the byproduct from pressing oil from flax seeds, can be fed to livestock.",

The edible part of the plant is a bundle of leaf sheaths that is sometimes erroneously called a stem or stalk. Historically, many scientific names were used for leeks, but they are now all treated as cultivars of A. ampeloprasum. The name 'leek' developed from the Anglo-Saxon word \"leac\". Two closely related vegetables, elephant garlic and kurrat, are also cultivars of A. ampeloprasum, although different in their uses as food. The onion and garlic are also related, being other species of the genus Allium.\nLeeks have thick blue-green foliage. The bundle of white leaf sheaths has a mild onion taste and can be blanched, steamed, braised, or grilled and used in soups, stews, omelet fillings, and more. The leaves can be used to make stock.\n\nPlant their leeks in autumn, and they should fatten up in time for winter picking. Plant them early to ensure they have enough time to grow before winter. Leeks take up to six months to mature after transplanting.\n\nNewer cultivars have quicker maturity  three to four months. Maturity is often affected by temperature, available nutrients and water. \n\nLeeks need a soil that is rich in organic matter. Dig in compost or manure two weeks before planting. Add fertiliser every few weeks\nLeeks like aged manure, especially chicken manure, and worm castings, another excellent source of nutrients.\n\nPlant seedlings in full sun, with moist but well-drained deep soil. Raised beds are ideal. Water young plants frequently.\n\nThe white part of the leek is edible; the green is not. You can blanch the stems to increase the proportion of stem thats edible and to sweeten the taste. Do this to fully grown leeks. Tie a paper collar around each stem and gently hill the earth up around the stem. Be careful not to get soil between the paper collar and stem as the leek may rot.\nAs the plants grow, add another collar above the first one and hill up more soil. Be aware that slugs and snails can hide in the paper collars\n\nHarvest the leeks when stems are around 2.5cm in diameter. Dig carefully around the leek and lift with a garden fork. Do not pull, as the leek is likely to break.",

Wine grapes have smaller fruit with seeds, thicker skin (most of the aroma in wine comes from the skin), and a higher sugar content. Grapes are propagated through cuttings because seeds do not reliably yield the same type of plant as their parent. Most varieties are self-fertile, but some may need another plant for pollination. All grapes need to be trained to a support so they grow upward - this reduces disease risk and facilitates cultivation and harvest. Plants should not be allowed to produce fruit in the first few years - the plant's energy needs to be focused on establishing roots and vines. Grapes only produce fruit on new growth, or canes, and need to be pruned each year in late winter when the vines are still dormant. Heavy pruning results in higher fruit yields. Most grapes need about 150 chilling hours at temperatures below 10°C. Grapes need to be ripened on the vine.",

The four chestnut species produce trees that vary in size from shrubs to trees as tall as 60 meters. The European chestnut averages around 30 meters. Chinese and Japanese chestnuts tend to be wide-spreading, while European and American species are more consolidated. The American chestnut tree was largely destroyed by chestnut blight, a fungal disease, in the 20th century. The chestnut fruit grows in a spiny burr or cupule that splits open when the fruit is mature. The fruit has creamy white flesh and can germinate once the burr opens and falls to the ground. Unlike other nuts, chestnuts are high in carbohydrates rather than oil. They sweeten a few days after harvest as their starches begin to convert to sugar. Chestnuts are not self-fertile, and require another pollinator tree within 25 meters. Trees will bear fruit within 3-5 years of planting.",

Apricots are also classified as a section of the Prunus subgenus. The skin of plums can be coated with a waxy bloom or it can be shiny. Plums can be purple, green, yellow, or red. Shape varies from oval to globular. Plums can be dried to make prunes. European Plums require 800-900 hours of chilling during the winter, Japanese Plums require 300-500. Some varieties are self-pollinating, but all plum trees benefit from a pollination partner with the same bloom time within 15 meters. Standard and dwarf rootstocks are available. Dwarf trees can grow to 3 meters, standard to 4.5 meters. Depending on the size chosen, the tree will bear fruit within 3-6 years of planting.",

Immature fruit are green and covered in gray-white hair, most of which rubs off by the time the fruit is ripe. Quince can also be grown for ornamental purposes because of their striking white to red blossoms, twisted branches, and large leaves with fuzzy undersides. Some varieties are bred specifically for ornamental purposes and will not produce good fruit. Do not confuse Quince with Chinese Quince (Chaenomeles sinensis), which is a flowering ornamental that fruits poorly. Quince trees are cold-hardy to -23.3 °C and have a winter chilling requirement of 100-500 hours depending on the cultivar. Quince flowers are hermaphroditic and the trees are self-pollinating, but they will have higher fruit yields if another quince variety is planted nearby for cross-pollination. Fruit ripen on the tree in 5-6 months and snap easily from the branch when ripe. Quince will continue to ripen and soften after harvest. Ripe fruit are deeply fragrant but usually too hard and tart to eat fresh. When cooked, Quince has a slightly spicy, deeply rich flavor that pairs well with dried fruit or apples. Some varieties have been bred for fresh eating, and leaving the fruits on the tree through a frost is said to make them sweeter. Seeds are poisonous in large quantities. Transplanted saplings will fruit in three years.",

To grow, transplant plugs or crowns in early spring in rows spaced at least 120cm apart. Pinch off all flowers the first season and train the plant's runners, pressing them into the soil 15-22cm apart from the mother plant. Mulch with straw or pine needles in the fall when the plants have died back. When the plants start to grow back in the spring, move the mulch aside. After harvest the second season, set a lawnmower to about 10cm high and mow, being sure not to damage crowns.\n\n The other two types are \n\n2) Ever-bearing and 3) Day Neutral, both of which send out less runners and bear several crops of smaller fruit throughout the season. These two types can be grown using raised beds about 20cm high and 60cm wide. Transplant crowns or plugs in staggered double rows, about 30cm apart. Remove runners and flowers until July of the first year to give the roots time to develop, and then allow plants to produce fruit. All types of strawberries begin to produce fewer and less sweet fruit once they are two years or older. Because strawberries are a hybrid, seeds will not breed true. Strawberries are predominantly propagated using bare root plugs or crowns or dividing runners. Make sure not to bury the crown when transplanting plugs.",

Like other walnut species, it has a broad crown and short trunk and needs full sunlight to grow well. The English Walnut is the most commonly available commercial nut, but it is sometimes confused with the Black Walnut, which is native to North America. English Walnuts have thinner shells that are easier to crack and more mild-flavored nuts than Black Walnuts. They have larger leaflets than Black Walnuts and their bark is gray-black and deeply grooved. English Walnuts grow where the temperature range is 7.0 to 21.1°C. When fully dormant, they can survive temperatures of -24 to -27° C. Temperatures below -29° C will kill the tree. English Walnuts need 500-1500 hours at temperatures below 7° C a year. Walnuts are dioecious, meaning they have both male and female flowers on the same tree and are therefore self-pollinating. However, the flowers do not always bloom at the same time. This problem can be solved by planting another walnut cultivar upwind whose catkins shed pollen at the same time the female flowers of the primary tree are open. Walnuts, like Hickories, contain a chemical called juglone, which inhibits the growth of many other plants. They are also difficult to grow other plants with because mature trees use a lot of water and shade large areas around them. The plants listed as companion plants can tolerate juglone. Grafted trees will begin to produce fruit one year after transplanting. Trees grown from seed will take 8-10 years to begin bearing fruit and may not bear true to the parent if trees have been cross-pollinated. Direct seeding is most effective when seeds are sown outdoors in autumn. Winter temperatures will break the seed's dormancy. If starting from seed indoors, pre-soak, scarify, and cold-stratify before planting to break dormancy.",
